[Demo Page](https://wiktorw0.github.io/quizzical/)

***Quizzical is the last solo project from [React Course - Beginner's Tutorial for React JavaScript Library 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bMknfKXIFA8) made by [Bob Ziroll](https://github.com/bobziroll).***
</br>
***Last solo project from the course build and design from scratch by myself. The purpose of this project was to check and develop acquired skills in React framework.***
</br>

***The only thing thas was left from original project is the idea about building a quiz app. I changed the design and expanded the functionalities proposed in the original project. I used knowledge from Youtube app to add and implement MUI components and functionalities. Quick test of skills before starting to learn*** `Typescript` ***and*** `Tailwind CSS`.
